                    Once upon a time, on the north coast of Sumatra lived a poor 
                    woman and his son. The boy was called Malin Kundang. They didn’t 
                    earn much as fishing was their only source of income. Malin Kundang 
                    grew up as a skillful young boy. He always helps his mother to earn some money.
                    However, as they were only fisherman’s helper, they still lived in poverty.
                    “Mother, what if I sail overseas?” asked Malin Kundang one day to his mother.
                    Her mother didn’t agree but Malin Kundang had made up his mind. 
                    “Mother, if I stay here, I’ll always be a poor man. I want to be a successful person,” 
                    urged Malin kundang. His mother wiped her tears, “If you really want to go, I can’t stop you. 
                    I could only pray to God for you to gain success in life,” said his mother wisely.
                    “But, promise me, you’ll come home.”

                    In the next morning, Malin Kundang was ready to go. Three days ago, 
                    he met one of the successful ship’s crew. Malin was offered to join him.
                    “Take a good care of yourself, son,” said Malin Kundang’s mother
                    as she gave him some food supplies. “Yes, Mother,” Malin Kundang said. 
                    “You too have to take a good care of yourself. I’ll keep in touch with you,”
                    he continued before kissing his mother’s hand. Before Malin stepped onto the ship, 
                    Malin’s mother hugged him tight as if she didn’t want to let him go.

                it had been three months since Malin Kundang left his mother. 
                As his mother had predicted before, he hadn’t contacted her yet.
                Every morning, she stood on the pier. She wished to see the ship that brought Malin kundang home. 
                Every day and night, she prayed to the God for her son’s safety. 
                There was so much prayer that had been said due to her deep love for Malin Kundang. 
                Even though it’s been a year she had not heard any news from Malin Kundang,
                she kept waiting and praying for him.
