                    Once upon a time, on the north coast of Sumatra lived a poor 
                    woman and his son. The boy was called Malin Kundang. They didn’t 
                    earn much as fishing was their only source of income. Malin Kundang 
                    grew up as a skillful young boy. He always helps his mother to earn some money.
                    However, as they were only fisherman’s helper, they still lived in poverty.
                    “Mother, what if I sail overseas?” asked Malin Kundang one day to his mother.
                    Her mother didn’t agree but Malin Kundang had made up his mind. 
                    “Mother, if I stay here, I’ll always be a poor man. I want to be a successful person,” 
                    urged Malin kundang. His mother wiped her tears, “If you really want to go, I can’t stop you. 
                    I could only pray to God for you to gain success in life,” said his mother wisely.
                    “But, promise me, you’ll come home.”
